1. Class and Object (With Example)
2. Class has Data/Attribute and Function/Methods
    > Code Workthrough
    > Attribute get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called Object Oriented Programming language?
    > Everything in Python is an object (Data Structure, DataType etc)
    > Developer Make (DataTypes and its Method with Hardwork and provide us)
4. Advantages of OOPS: 
    > you can create your own DataTypes
    > Code Resuability
    > Debugging
    > Easy to Colab
